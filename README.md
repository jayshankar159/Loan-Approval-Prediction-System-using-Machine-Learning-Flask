# Loan-Approval-Prediction-System-using-Machine-Learning-Flask
A machine learning based web application that predicts loan approval status using applicant details. Built with Logistic Regression, Scikit-learn Pipeline, and Flask, supporting real-time user input through a web interface.
📌 Loan Approval Prediction System

This project is an end-to-end Machine Learning Classification application that predicts whether a loan will be approved or rejected based on applicant information such as income, credit history, education, and property area.
The trained ML model is deployed using Flask and can take real user input from a web form.
